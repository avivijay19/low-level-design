- when writing code for a software application, you may encounter situations where you need to implement different algorithms or strategies for a specific task.
- for example, consider a payment processing system that supports multiple payment methods such as credit card,
- debit card, and digital wallets. each payment method may have its own unique algorithm for processing payments.
- in such cases, using a single implementation for all payment methods can lead to complex and hard
- to-maintain code. this is where the strategy design pattern comes into play.
